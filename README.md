# Computer Science Game
 The most updated version of my Programming Project!
 
 To find the actual code for the project go to Computer Science Game > Assets > Scripts and navigate the folders from there!
 (Ignore .meta files as they are autogenerated by unity for it's own functionality)
 All scripts are in .cs format, written in C#.
 
 For assets and images used go to Computer Science Game > Assets > Textures
 
 Thanks!
